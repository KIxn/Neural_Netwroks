# Neural_Netwroks Description

Simple implementation of a neural network to predict classes on a randomly distrubted dataset on a non-linear decision boundary.

#Usage
To improve the predictions of the network, increase the number of nodes in the hidden-layer.
This can be done by adjusting the variable  (on line 96) numofnodes = 15
